# Curated Open Textbooks

An attempt to construct a heavily opinionated, tightly curated dataset of core knowledge. Focus will be textbooks, but may also include lecture transcripts/slides, course notes, etc.

## Motivation

Goal is to build an extremely information-dense dataset for model finetuning in support of STEM research activities.

Links will be preferntially to PDFs for standardization. Source code should be linked where available, but for now I'm operating under the assumption that everything will need to go through a PDF processing pipeline. 

My main focus here is colelcting materials for machine processing, but I am also including "portal" pages to e.g. help human learniners find associated course content and/or more human-readable presentation.
